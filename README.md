# HelloWorldLab

This project is a simple greeting that utilizes some basic features in Android Studio. 
Once the app is started, a user first sees a text bar at the top that says "Hello World", an editable text box that asks for the user's name, and a "click me" button.
If the user decides to enter a name, and then clicks the button, the "Hello World" will be replaced with "Hi ___", where the blank is the user's name.
Whatever text is typed into the box, regardless if it is the user's name or not, will be replaced with World.
This is a good project for new Android Studio users to play around with and build upon.
